# NBA-Draft-Project
​Growing up and playing basketball all of my life, this particular project sparked a large interest of mine as it is about the NBA. I have been watching the NBA ever since I can remember and NBA draft nights were one of the highlights of each offseason. Who would be the #1 pick? This is the question that is pondered upon as the clock counts down and the commissioner steps onto the podium to announce the pick. This project is an analysis of how NBA teams have drafted over the 2018 and 2019 drafts. Using machine learning techniques, I tried to find what players are sleepers or busts. The data I used derived from basketballreference.com where I got all my data from.
